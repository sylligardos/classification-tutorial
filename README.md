# **Time Series Classification - Lab 2**  

This repository contains a hands-on **tutorial** on **Time Series Classification**, designed as part of an **AI & Big Data** course. It includes structured exercises that guide you through key classification techniques, from **distance-based methods** to **deep learning approaches**.  

## **Overview**  

The tutorial is divided into **six parts**, progressively increasing in complexity:  

1. **Understanding the Data** – Visualizing and analyzing time series datasets.  
2. **Distance-Based Classification** – Implementing **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** and exploring distance measures.  
3. **Feature-Based Classification** – Extracting features with **Catch22** and training a simple classifier.  
4. **Neural Network Classifiers** – Building and training a **linear classifier** on extracted features.  
5. **Raw Time Series Classification** – Implementing a **1D-CNN** to classify time series directly.  
6. **Discussion** – Reflecting on results and understanding the trade-offs between methods.  

## **How to Use the Tutorial**  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
   cd your_repo
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab**  
   - Upload the `.ipynb` file to **Google Colab**.  
   - Follow the instructions in each section.  
   - Complete the exercises and answer the discussion questions.  

3. **Deliverables**
   - Submit a **.ipynb file** with your solutions.  
   - Export and submit a **PDF of the executed notebook**.
